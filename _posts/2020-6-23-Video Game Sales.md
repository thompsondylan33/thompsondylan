## Hypothesis
### Are Different Genres of Video Games More or Less Popular in Different Countries?

I have gathered a DataFrame containing Video Game sales from 1990 - 2013  and their Total sales, European Sales, North American sales, and Japanese sales.I have chosen to compare these 3 regions because their sales are most  prevalent in the video games industry. The genres on my dataframe getting compared are
*	Action
*	Adventure
*	Fighting
*	Misc
*	Platform
*	Puzzle
*	Racing
*	Role Playing
*	Shooter
*	Simulation
*	Sports
*	Strategy

Misc. is going to refer to any game that does not fit nicely into any of the other categories.

I have grouped all of the Video Games by how much money they made, for the highest earning games  (over $1 million) I have labeled them “Very Good”, the next highest grossing games (from $100,000 - $1million)  “Good”, Video games grossing from $10,000 to $100,000 are labeled as “Medium”, and finally Games grossing under $10,000 are labeled as “Low”.


When we look at the video game sales in North America, we can clearly tell that “Action” Games are overwhelmingly  more popular than any other Genre, but also “Action” has some of the most games that sold under $10,000, but that  might be because of the sheer amount of games that are in the “Action” genre. Another Genre that has the same amount of undersold Games is “Adventure”.

After seeing the results, we can conclude that “Action” is the most popular – if not the most finicky- Genre of games sold,  and “Adventure” is the least popular sold in North America.



When looking at the Video Game Sales in Europe, they are remarkably like that of North America.

“Action” once again has a vast number of games that made over $1million, while it also has the most amount of  games that made under $10,000. Although close behind “Action” is “Misc” and “Adventure”

With this we can conclude that once again “Action” is the most popular of all the games sold,  while “Adventure”, “Action”, and “Misc.”  are the least popular.

When looking at action games as some of the regions least popular games we must remember that it is simply  because of the sheer number of Action games that are produced, as when an Acton game is undersold it is commonly  undersold in every region, but even still Japan seems to differ from North America and Europe

In Japan, the video games sales vary extremely when compared to that of Europe and North America. While  in the other 2 regions “Action” is at the top of the charts in every category, in Japan “Role-Playing” has  by far the most amount of games sold that made over $1million and “Action” is in 5th place – behind “platform”, “Sports”,  and “Misc.”. While “Action” and “Sports” has the most games that are undersold.

While Role-Playing games did not sell so well in North America or Europe, there are still some well known Games in that list,  like the very well known 'Final Fantasy' games.

After looking at all that data we can conclude that different genres of games do sell differently in different regions.  In North America and Europe the most popular genre of games sold are in the “Action” category, while in Japan the most  popular games are in the “Role-Playing” category. Inversely, the least popular games in North America, and Europe are “Action”,  “Adventure”, “Misc.” and “Role-Playing”,While in Japan the least popular games sold are “Action” and “Sports”. So in conclusion,  Games sales in Europe and North America are very similar while Game sales in Japan differ greatly.
